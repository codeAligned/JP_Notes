JP Numpy / Pandas / Matplotlib Notes:


`df.isnull().sum()` -- counts of all NaNs in all cols.

use `argsort()` in numpy to sort by a column in a matrix




Use `ipython --pylab` (or `%gui` ?) to enable interactive mode with IPython and MPL.  You can continue to work in IPy while a plot is displayed.
