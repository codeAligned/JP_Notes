### Places to Find Cool Companies and Startups
James says don't run to job boards yet.  Look at companies and try to make direct applications.

1. builtincolorado.com
  + They have a good job board, but look at the *startups* tab first.  Over 2,000 companies here in CO.  Make a profile.

2. BDnewtech (I have joined on Meetup.com)
3. Angel List
  + Make sure to have a complete profile.  Sort of the "Startup Bible."  One click applications.
4. Galvanize Jobs Board

**Other Places**
+ Slack
  + \#colorado-events (via Galvanize)
  + https://denverdevs.org/ (Denver Devs)
  + https://gettechfriends.com/ (Boulder Tech Friends)
  + slack.bdnt.org (BD New Tech)

+ Quora and StackOverflow
  + Answer questions and get more recognition; builds profile of activity and knowledge, and helping out.  Easy to do, nice payback.

+ Make your own tech blog

### Job Boards
+ [DataTau](http://www.datatau.com/) (James' favorite)
+ Hacker News: [Who Is Hiring](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring)
  + Monthly thread on who is hiring, very specific and sort of a hidden gem in the tech world. Limited quantity but the "highest quality listings out there", according to James.

+ Angel List
+ VentureLoop
+ StackOverflow
  + Adam says they take most job applications very seriously, but you have to show you are an active user who knows your stuff and helps others.
+ Indeed.com/Monster/etc
  + James says he largely avoids these as they're too generic, flooded with applications, and not tech-centric
+ Glassdoor
  + Big, generic
+ Kaggle
+ BreakoutList
+ Github
  + Unique job board, integrates with your repos
+ Codepen

+ Dice -- James and Adam both say this is absolute garbage, spam-filled. DO NOT USE.

### Platform
James says these methods are growing in popularity, but won't let you in to the site/platform if the position you are seeking isn't available.  So, if you want Data Science jobs and there are non currently, you won't be able to use the platform.
+ Hired.com
+ Interviewing.io
+ TripleByte


### Automated Job Alerts
can use IFTTT to send automated alerts
Adam has a great tip -- use the RSS feed of these listing sites to get XML sent straight to you, and scrape from that instead of the actual live site, to get all the info you need. Can set a script to go every morning at 8a to take the RSS feed and scrape and alert you when certain jobs are listed.

### The "Title" of the Job
"Data Scientist" is a broad term.  James has provided many roughly synonymous titles that you should search for when looking for a job which will greatly expand your results.


### The Right Questions to Ask
Different questions for different people.
**Come to each interview with a typed list of questions you want to ask them during the interview. It shows them you are serious and take initiative.**
+ Recruiters:
  + James says you get what you pay for in recruiters.  Cheap ones can be pretty worthless.
  + What is the interview process?
  + what should I be prepared for?
  + how is this company different from others?
  + Make sure to not ask questions that are already answered on their website! Do basic research.

+ Data Scientists:
  + How would we work together?
  + Hardest technical challenge [company/team] faces?
  + How to make a significant impact in the firs three months?
  + Data Collection?
  + Visualization?
  + Experimentation?

+ (Your Future) Manager:
  + If you aren't scheduled to meet with your manager, request it.
  + How would we work together?
  + How to significantly impact in the first three months?
  + What are the strengths/weaknesses of the this team?
  + Will the team grow?
  + What would my first project be?

+ Product / Design
  + (missed slide)

+ VP and C-Level
  + 5 year plan?
  + What is our business model?
  + This year's company goals?
  + Reason for joining?

+ The "Just Coffee" Trap!
  + Always be prepared to speak about a recent project (capstone!)
  + Look for ways to demonstrate your competency
  + Know the stories you want to tell
  + Make the time high-impact and productive. AOBAU.


### Bring Your Stories
Have your stories ready ahead of time.
+ Strengths/Weaknesses
  + Any time you are asked to give a weakness, also add a strength.  Try to name weaknesses that are mitigated in your role (i.e. if you're doing DS research, listing "confrontation" as a weakness is fine because you aren't in charge of others, but if you are going to be a manager, listing "confrontation" as a weakness is a huge mistake because you are going to have to keep the cattle in line.)

+ Hardest Challenges
  + Use whatever challenge gave you the best result, even if it wasn't actually your strongest challenge.  Don't list a challenge that destroyed you and forced you to quit.

+ Storytelling Technique:
  + Much like a heroic movie script.  (see slide)

### Preparations
  + Videos available for the company you're applying to
  + Meetups to network and learn
  + News
  + LinkedIn & Twitter: research your interviewers
  + Homepage.  Lot of great info here.
  + Download Their Product and USE IT -- understand what they are about

+ Technical Areas of Competency
  + Flash Cards slacked out are a great resource. Below is a brief list.
  + Predictive
  + (more, see slide)

+ Non-Technical Areas
  + Communication
  + Presentation
  + Curiosity
  + Responsiveness
  + Persistence
  + "The best in their fields share these 3 common traits:
    1. They work harder.
    2. They don't make excuses.
    3. They're always learning."

+ "Why This Company?"
  + More than "I just want a job."  That makes them know you aren't going to contribute.
  + This company is a leader in the space; I know this because... (I use your product...)
  + I'm an avid user of

### Follow Up with a Thank You
+ Thank you for taking time to me with me
+ I enjoyed our conversation and was excited to learn about...
+ Following up with what we discussed, I wanted to link you to the article I referenced about ...
+ Be as specific to the actual interview that happened as possible
+ Timing:
  + Within 2 hours of a phone interview
  + 24 hours of an onsite interview
  + No excuses. Period. Do it.
  + Handwritten notes on nice cards work really well.  Might consider dropping off in person if the organization is very large (prevent getting lost in the structure of the organization)


### Application Process
**Application Funnel**
We want to apply to as many companies at roughly the same time so that as things progress with each company, they do so on the same timeline.  Think of it like a funnel, start with a wide opening at the top (lot of companies) and then progress through it as the number of responses and interviews dwindle.  *Watch the Greg Kamardt video!*

Keep a spreadsheet of all the companies you've applied, when you've emailed, when you heard back, a link to the job listing, etc. so that you know what the status is for every job app. (If you haven't heard back in a while check the listing to see if it is closed.)
There are some apps to help with this as well.
+ Trello
+ GoJobHero.com (Chrome plugin, Jobhero Sidekick)
+ AirTable (Jame's fav; Google Sheets on steroids)



### Negotiation
When negotiating, sell yourself on your skills, not on your personal needs.
Avoid disclosing any target salary until they go first.  Avoid disclosing previous salary if possible.

[salar.ly](www.salarly.com) has great job position salaries.
