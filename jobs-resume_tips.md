# Resume Tips from James

#### Top complaints:
1. mistakes
2. disorganized
3. lack of substance
4. poor job fit
5. cliche phrases / buzz words


#### Aesthetically Pleasing:
1. One page
2. standard margins
3. one classic typeface
4. black font color
5. labeled sections
6. reverse-chronological order
7. consistent punctuation and nomenclature
8. Include flat icons for sites, like LinkedIn or Github, as well as for phone, email, and location (maps marker symbol)


#### Section 1 : header
+ First and last name
+ city and state in which you currently live
+ phone number
+ email address
+ hyperlinked URL to your Github Profile
+ hyperlinked URL to your linkedIn profile
+ Can list Meyers-Briggs
+ List Mensa here? or in groups/passions?
+ NEVER use a photo; in many places this violates HR policy and disqualifies you.

The technical resume includes two sections not found on a traditional resume: Skills and Projects

#### Section 2 : skills
Avoid personal fluff skills like "hard worker" or "team player", etc.  Those are expected.  We want to list cool python libraries or projects.  Lead with your strongest skills.  If your only exposure to a certain technology/language/algorithm was in a particular project, and you don't consider yourself adept/comfortable with it beyond that, then list it IN the bullet points under the project itself and NOT in the skills section.


#### Section 3 : projects
Title Bar
+ Project title
+ Project URL
+ Dates started and finished/in-progress  (this can be detrimental if too short, might omit)
+ List case studies done in DSI on your LinkedIn profile; avoid using on TalentGalvanize because everyone will have that same thing.  Avoid using on resume unless you further explored them with consequence.
+ Depending on depth/breadth/quality of capstone, can list it in Experience instead of projects.

#### Short Description
+ What, why, how
+ Technologies/skills used
+ role on team (if applicable)


#### Section 4 : Experience
Title Bar
+ Job Title
+ Company name
+ city and state
+ dates of employment
-- be transparent, if worked an unglamorous job, consider listing it to show you weren't unemployed.
-- Go back 2-3 jobs unless job was relevant, 3-4 bullet points per job
-- list research at CU under education


#### Bullet Point Tips:
+ start with an action verb (achieved, added, awarded, changed, contributed, decreased, delivered, eliminated, exceeded, expanded, gained, generated, grew, improved, increased, introduced, maximized, minimized, optimized, produced, reduced, saved)
+ avoid long acronyms that are industry-specific.
+ don't need to be complete sentences


#### Section 5 : education
+ Add Galvanize Data Science Immersive ('Immersive' is a special definition here, must include it.  Avoid words like 'boot camp' etc)
+ Just write 2016 for Galvanize, not the months

+ Galvanize Data Science Immersive
+ Data Science Fellow
+ Denver, CO
+ 2016


+ University of Colorado
+ Boulder, CO
+ dates attended
+ B.S. Chemistry, Math


#### Misc Notes
+ Can also list Coursera/online courses completed, but give them their own sub-headers under education. (Coursera: IIPP etc)


Activities and Passions:
+ list relevant groups and meetings you attend (Denver PyData, Analyze Boulder, etc.)



ALWAYS send resume as a PDF to avoid local computer replacement of font and formatting.  Title it descriptively: jonpaul-wright-[company name]-resume.PDF and same for cover letter.
